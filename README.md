Student Data Analysis Using Excel &amp; Power BI â€“ Hash Plus Bootcamp

## Analyzing Student Experiences in Online and Face-to-Face Learning

This project explores the level of academic engagement, teaching quality, and the impact of academic support in both online and face-to-face education systems.

Data was collected through a survey distributed to students at my online university and peers from traditional, in-person universities, with support from Copilot tools.

The analysis offers a comparative perspective on student performance and engagement, aiming to provide deeper insights into the overall student experience
